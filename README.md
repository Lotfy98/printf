#printf Project

printf is a C standard library function that stands for "print formatted." It is widely used for output formatting in C and C++ programs. printf allows you to generate formatted output by specifying a format string and one or more additional arguments. Here's a brief overview of how printf works:

Format String: The printf function takes a format string as its first argument. This format string can contain plain text characters and format specifiers. Format specifiers start with a percent sign (%) and are used to specify how the additional arguments should be formatted and inserted into the string.

Variadic Arguments: After the format string, printf accepts a variable number of arguments. These arguments provide the values to be inserted into the format string at the corresponding format specifiers.

Format Specifiers: Format specifiers in the format string determine how the corresponding arguments are formatted. Common format specifiers include:

1- %d for signed integers
2- %u for unsigned integers
3- %f for floating-point numbers
4- %s for strings
5- %c for characters
6- %x for hexadecimal integers
7- %p for pointers
Printing: When printf encounters a format specifier in the format string, it replaces the specifier with the corresponding argument value, formatted according to the specifier, and appends it to the output stream (typically the console). The order of arguments should match the order of format specifiers.

Return Value: printf returns the total number of characters printed, excluding the null-terminating character ('\0').
